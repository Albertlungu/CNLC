## Overview and project plan (my notes from Jan 4 call):
**Prompt**: A byte-sized business boost
- Use programming skills to support small local businesses in their community
	- Can be in the form of:
		- CLI
		- Desktop app
		- Interactive interface
	- Should include:
		- Program should include sorting by category (food, retail services)
		- Review/rating (also sort by these)
		- Saving/bookmarking fav businesses
		- Display special deals/coupons
		- Verification step to prevent bot activity
	- *Could also include other info (date created, owner name, history, etc.)*
	- *Recent order history sharing* - this would help discover new businesses from friends that have similar tastes
	- *Fetch data from business website and display on app*
	- *3D model of inside of store* - show vibe and help decide if it's desirable or not
	- *Recommendation model* - user data is put into an ML model and cross-referenced with other users to recommend a place they would like:
		- People who liked X also discovered Y
	- *Points system* - money -> points -> "ratings" (sort of)
